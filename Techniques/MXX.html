<h1>MXX: Providing touch access for custom controls</h1>

<strong>Note: I will revise this content to fit the M000 template. If you create a page for  "Providing touch access for custom controls" I will then move content there.</strong>

<h2>Applicability</h2>

<p>This technique applies to touch and pointer operating modes.</p>

<p>This technique relates to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Success Criterion 2.5.1 Touch: All functions available by touch are still available by touch after system assistive technology that remaps touch gestures is turned on. (Level A) 
</ul>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Custom controls web interfaces may not be suitable for touch access when the built-in screen reader of mobile operating systems is enabled.</p>
<p>Where default touch gestures do not work because of screen reader gestures that take precedence, ensure that there are equivalent alternative ways of activating or changing the state or value of the control.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<p>In the default operating mode (screen reader not enabled), a slider can be used to change a value by moving the thumb of the slider. When a screen reader is turned on, the direct manipulation does not work. Theerefore a different method is provided to set the value of the slider. Discrete marks along the slider representing a scale of values may be selected by first moving the focus to  the mark and then selecting the focued mark by double-tapping.</p>
